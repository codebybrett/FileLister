# FileLister

Like "Copy Path" in Windows Explorer but with basic templating to generate commands, lists from filenames using drag and drop or copy/paste.

Drag and drop files or copy and paste from Windows Explorer or other programs onto this utility.

When you "Copy" from this utility it copies a text listing of the files formatted according to your selected template to the clipboard.

Choose one of the templates or enter your own format into the format box - look at the built in ones for examples of what's available.

It's a quick and dirty tool, expect the occassional problem.
